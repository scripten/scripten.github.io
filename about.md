Hello, and welcome to my blog, Code Marathon. I'm a computer programmer about to
to cut my teeth in the tech industry. As an exercise in self-education and as
a project of personal curiosity, I will be teaching myself a new programming
language every week. My intention is to go beyond simply presenting a
"Hello world!" example in myriad languages, but to learn something new
and unique, maybe even beautiful, about each language I encounter.
