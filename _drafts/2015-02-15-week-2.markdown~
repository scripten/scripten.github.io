If it's not apparent from the title of this post, JavaScript is toted by its
creators as "the Programming Language of the Web". With its roots in
client-side scripts run from web pages, JavaScript has grown to take on a great
number of other applications, including game development, server-side web
applications, and desktop widgets.  Like Python (and, for that matter, Java),
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language, employing various
programming paradigms.  One can write using imperative, object-oriented, and
functional concepts in the same application, depending on the program's needs.
