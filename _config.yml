  Hi! I'm Kevin and I'm embarking on a journey to learn a new programming
  language every week. I'm currently a senior at SUNY Potsdam working
  toward a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. At the start
  of this project, I am currently fluent in Python, Java, and C++. I am
  also familiar with Lua, Prolog, and various scripting languages
  designed for video game modding applications.
