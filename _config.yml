  Hi! I'm Kevin and I'm embarking on a journey to learn a new programming
  language every week. I'm currently a senior at SUNY Potsdam (that's a
  fairly small liberal arts college operating out of Potsdam, NY, USA)
   working toward a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, but
  soon I hope to be a recent graduate working in Seattle, WA, USA. At the
  start of this project, I currently am fluent in Python, Java, and C++
  and familiar with Lua, Prolog, and various tiny scripting languages
  designed for video game modding applications.
